** About me
:PROPERTIES: 
:EXPORT_HUGO_CUSTOM_FRONT_MATTER: :resume-path /static/resume.pdf
:EXPORT_FILE_NAME: about-me
:END:

My name is Martin Mariano and I'm a passionate developer interested in
web development, embedded systems and tons of other stuff. I founded
the CS2 marketplace (originally on cs:go)
[[https://mercadoskin.com][MercadoSkin]] and authored some rust open
source projects.

I'm currently living in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil and open for work. If you
want to contact me, you can reach me via one of the following
communication channels:

    - via [[mailto:contato@martinmariano.com][email]]
    - find me on [[https://github.com/saskenuba][github]]
    - or [[https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinmariano][linkedIn]]

My usual nickname is saskenuba.

All of the open source stuff I work on is MIT licensed which means you
can do with it whatever you want.

*** About this Website

The website itself is written with org-mode and exported to markdown
using org-hugo.

*** Why saskenuba?

Oh god. I was 12 years old, okay? It is a word play of "Sasuke" (a
character from the Naruto anime) and noob. Yes, I was nerdy (still am,
though).

*** Misc

As of 02-20-2024, I can bench 90kg; squat 117kg and deadlift 140kg. I
was once run over by a motorcycle.
