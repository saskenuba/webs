My name is Martin Mariano and I'm a passionate developer interested in
web development, embedded systems and tons of other stuff. I founded
the CS2 marketplace (originally on cs:go)
[MercadoSkin](https://mercadoskin.com) and authored some rust open
source projects.

I'm currently living in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil and open for work. If you
want to contact me, you can reach me via one of the following
communication channels:

-   via [email](mailto:contato@martinmariano.com)
-   find me on [github](https://github.com/saskenuba)
-   or [linkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinmariano)

My usual nickname is saskenuba.

All of the open source stuff I work on is MIT licensed which means you
can do with it whatever you want.


## About this Website {#about-this-website}

The website itself is written with org-mode and exported to markdown
using org-hugo.


## Why saskenuba? {#why-saskenuba}

Oh god. I was 12 years old, okay? It is a word play of "Sasuke" (a
character from the Naruto anime) and noob. Yes, I was nerdy (still am,
though).


## Misc {#misc}

As of 02-20-2024, I can bench 90kg; squat 117kg and deadlift 140kg. I
was once run over by a motorcycle.
